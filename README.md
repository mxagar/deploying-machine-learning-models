# Machine Learning Model Deployment Guide

This repository contains my guide to deploy ML models. The repository was forked from 

[deploying-machine-learning-models](https://github.com/trainindata/deploying-machine-learning-models)

which contains the companion code of the Udemy course [Deployment of Machine Learning Models](https://www.udemy.com/course/deployment-of-machine-learning-models) by Soledad Galli & Christopher Samiullah.

The guide or notes for my future self done after following the course are in: `./ML_Deployment_Guide.md`.

## Contents of the Repository
