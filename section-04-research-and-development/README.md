# Machine Learning Model Deployment Guide: Research and Development Environment

This folder contains a case study in which the [House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/) from Kaggle is prepared in the **research/development environment** . The content structured following the Udemy course [Deployment of Machine Learning Models](https://www.udemy.com/course/deployment-of-machine-learning-models) by Soledad Galli & Christopher Samiullah.

Note that the authors of that course have a repository, which I forked: 

[deploying-machine-learning-models](https://github.com/mxagar/deploying-machine-learning-models)

However, since I started to re-organize and annotate the content substantially, I decided to move the notebooks here manually, to work on them independently. Given that fact, note that notebook and code authorship is originally and mainly from Soledad Galli & Christopher Samiullah.

For a detailed guide of the course, look in `../ML_Deployment_Guide.md`.
